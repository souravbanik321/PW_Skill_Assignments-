    "Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to scale numerical data to a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1. This technique rescales the data so that the minimum value in the dataset maps to 0 and the maximum value maps to 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n",

    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a large set of variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables, called principal components.
