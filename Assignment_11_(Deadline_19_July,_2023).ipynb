        "\n",
        "23. RNN-based techniques handle long-term dependencies in text processing by maintaining and updating a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps. This hidden state enables RNNs to retain information over longer sequences, allowing them to capture dependencies that span across multiple words or positions. By incorporating information from the past, RNNs can capture contextual relationships and dependencies critical for understanding and generating coherent text.\n",
