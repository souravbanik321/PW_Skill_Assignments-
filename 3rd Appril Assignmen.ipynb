Precision measures the proportion of correctly classified positive instances out of all predicted positive instances, while recall measures the proportion of correctly classified positive instances out of all actual positive instances.

    "Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary response variable as a function of one or more predictor variables. However, it can also be extended to perform multiclass classification using several approaches. Two common approaches for using logistic regression for multiclass classification are one-vs-all (OvA) and softmax regression.\n",

    "In the OvA approach, we train K different logistic regression models, where K is the number of classes. Each model is trained to distinguish one of the K classes from the rest, so we end up with K binary classifiers. When making a prediction, we use all K models to generate K probability scores for the instance, and then select the class with the highest probability score as the predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In softmax regression, we model the probability of each class directly using a multinomial logistic regression model. Specifically, we use the softmax function to compute the probability of each class, given the input features. The softmax function takes the form of a generalization of the logistic function to multiple classes, where the outputs are normalized so that they sum to one. The model parameters are learned by optimizing the cross-entropy loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true probabilities. When making a prediction, we simply select the class with the highest probability score.\n",

    "Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The OvA approach is simple and easy to implement, but it can suffer from class imbalance and may not capture the correlations between the different classes. Softmax regression, on the other hand, directly models the joint probability of all the classes and can capture their correlations, but it is more complex and requires more computation.
