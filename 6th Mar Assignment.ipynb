Temperature is an example of interval data because it has a consistent interval between each degree, but zero degrees does not represent the complete absence of temperature.\n",
    "Example: A survey asks respondents to rate their happiness on a scale of 1-10. The scale represents interval data because the difference between a rating of 5 and a rating of 6 is the same as the difference between a rating of 9 and a rating of 10, but a rating of 0 is not possible.\n",

    "`Ratio Data:` Ratio data is numerical data that has a true zero point, representing the complete absence of the measured variable. This type of data allows for meaningful ratios to be calculated.\n",

Instead, we can use frequency tables or pie charts to display the data.\n",
