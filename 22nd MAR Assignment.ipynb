    "Ans: To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity, you will need to have collected data on both variables from a sample of 50 participants. Once you have collected the data, you can use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = (Σ(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / √(Σ(x - x̄)²Σ(y - ȳ)²)\n",
    "\n",
    "where x and y are the two variables (in this case, the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity), x̄ and ȳ are their respective means, and Σ represents the sum of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After plugging in the values and calculating the formula, you will get a value between -1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day increases, their level of physical activity also increases. A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day increases, their level of physical activity decreases. A value of 0 indicates no correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the result of the correlation coefficient calculation will depend on the value obtained. If the correlation coefficient is positive and close to 1, this would suggest a strong positive correlation between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity. This means that individuals who spend more time watching television tend to have higher levels of physical activity. On the other hand, if the correlation coefficient is negative and close to -1, this would suggest a strong negative correlation between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity. This would indicate that individuals who spend more time watching television tend to have lower levels of physical activity. Finally, if the correlation coefficient is close to 0, this would suggest that there is no correlation between the two variables, and the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day does not have a significant impact on their level of physical activity."
